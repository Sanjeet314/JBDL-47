Pls Explain(or add to) These Points wrt to what you told

1> When compared with "C++", developing multithreading examples is very easy 
in java because java provides in built support for multithreading through a rich 
API (Thread, Runnable, ThreadGroup, ThreadLocal...etc)?

2> In multithreading on 10% of the work the programmer is required to do and 
90% of the work will be down by java API.

3> Whether it is process based or Thread based the main objective of multitasking 
is to improve performance of the system by reducing response time.

How multithreading is very important during development. Please explain the application

sorry my bad, I got skipped can you explain the need of passing the runnable thread and passing it throw thread constructor cant we just use it like r.start();

ok so these are asynchronous but if we wanna make dsure of order we have to make itr synchronous
like things and mail and sms no need both to check but in cases where we need specific order ? Inter Thread Communication
